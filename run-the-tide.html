                <h3>RUN THE TIDE</h3>
                <p>A young man named Rey Hightower (Lautner), is a college drop-out who has been raising his ten-year-old younger half-brother, Oliver, ever since their mother was sent to prison for drug-related charges six years prior; her first husband—Rey's father—had abandoned them long before. Rey's high school sweetheart is in town for her late father's memorial service. She has graduated from college and is working for a tech company in San Francisco, while Rey works in his home town at a fuel station. They spend the night together on a lookout tower before her imminent return; she has told him to visit her and she'll help get him started in something (pitying his plight). Their mother has just been released, hopefully rehabilitated.</p>
